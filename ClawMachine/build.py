# Generate the event modifiers and the decision-tree event for the Claw Machine

# Ideally, these rewards should all be exciting and somewhat OP, if perhaps
# demanding on your playstyle (eg getting a Build Time bonus will mean you
# benefit by spamming buildings). They should be very VERY roughly balanced
# against each other. It's fine to have different numbers of rewards in the
# categories, but no reward should feel truly disappointing, and no category
# should feel unexciting or overly predictable.

# Map something to None if its corresponding modifier has been manually
# created in 00_clawmachine.txt, or to a number to automatically create the
# modifier in 01_clawmachine_effects.txt. To create a province modifier, set
# to a list containing the value instead, eg [10], and the effect will be
# applied to the country's capital.

# NOTE: Currently, the "back out" option doesn't reroll. According to the wiki,
# the solution is to use an on_action or province trigger to disconnect the
# event chain. Which seems odd, since this isn't actually an event chain.
