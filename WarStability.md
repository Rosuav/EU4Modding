Stability and War
=================

Note: This is a companion to the Claw Machine due to one of its potential
modifiers, but can also be a useful reference regardless.

No-CB, truce breaking, etc, will normally cost you stability, cause
immediate war exhaustion (WE), and add aggressive expansion (AE).

The "Stab Hit to Declare War" (SHDW) modifier will ONLY affect the stability
portion of this; it also (if positive) applies to wars that otherwise have
no penalty. It has no impact on WE or AE. The "deal with the devil" option
in the Claw Machine can potentially add a +3 stab penalty, OR it can give
a -10 stab effect (wiping out most other penalties) with another penalty.

Full Diplomatic ideas will lower the impact on stability of diplomatic
actions. This does not directly interact with the SHDW; +3 SHDW with diplo
ideas still costs you 3 stab (but nothing else). For other actions, it will
generally halve the penalties, and it *does* reduce the WE and AE.

Machiavellianism gives a -1 SHDW, and also increases AE. Combining diplo +
machi will reduce a no-CB war to 0 stab, 1 WE, 10 AE.

The Claw Machine with Machiavellianism combines additively as they are the
same modifier. Combining either with Diplo applies the diplo bonus first
(usually halving the penalty), and then adjusts the stab hit without any
change to WE/AE.
