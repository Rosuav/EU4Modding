Playing around with modding Europa Universalis IV.

The "Hacky Hack" mod is horrendously unbalancing and stupid, and it's just a
place where I fiddle around with different modifiers to see what I can do.
Other mods will actually be more interesting to play with.

Clone this repository into your Paradox EU4 directory. On Linux, that's
"~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod".
