Playing around with modding Europa Universalis IV.

The "Hacky Hack" mod is horrendously unbalancing and stupid, and it's just a
place where I fiddle around with different modifiers to see what I can do.
Other mods will actually be more interesting to play with.

Clone this repository into your Paradox EU4 directory. On Linux, that's
"~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod".

TODO: Can I change colony maintenance? Would be cool to have a national idea
or something that cuts colony maintenance drastically and gives one colonist,
but increases (say) army maintenance. Or maybe it has a monarch power cost
every month. Is that possible? Would be an interesting option for a small
nation in a largely uncolonized area.
